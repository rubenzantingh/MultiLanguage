# MultiLanguage

## Description
This addon aims to offer players the possibility to play the game in their preferred locale while also having access to the texts in another locale. It can offer players who don't have a certain locale as their primary language some help communicating with other players while discussing items, quests, or NPCs. On the other hand, it might also be used to passively learn a new language when playing. It was created for Season of Discovery but also works on Classic Era servers. Please note that this is a work in progress and in no way a finished product. As of now there are no plans to support additional versions of the game, but if there is enough interest this might change.
